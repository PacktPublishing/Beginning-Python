# Beginning Python [Video]
This is the code repository for [Beginning Python [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/beginning-python-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468994), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
This video will introduce the Python language.We will start with an overview of the language constructs how to create variables, arrays, working with strings, commenting etc.We will then move on to slightly more advanced topics that will stretch the skills of the viewer.The final part will either build a Python application with something like tkinter, build a simple website with Django or do something in the data science realm. The choice is up to the author, but the overriding point of the video is to show Python in context.This will be a lead-in product for the rest of Packts product line up.Will be use on the latest version of Python 3.6 where applicable. Im hoping will be released in March, and well have a few months to make sure everything is up to date. This wont be a huge feature of a beginner video though.
